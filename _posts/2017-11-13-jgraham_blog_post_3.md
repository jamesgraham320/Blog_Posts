**Vim Modes and why they matter**
-------------------

Vim is an editor that many see as cryptic and difficult to understand. I just want to shed a little bit of light on the foundation of vim so that everybody can have a basic understanding of how it works so that next time you see it, you won't get confused as to why you can't type.
Vim is based on three modes. Normal, Visual, and Insert mode. The three modes can be summarized as follows:

| Mode  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Normal | Use the keyboard to do commands |
| Visual | Use the keyboard to highlight text |
| Insert | Type normally |
