**What is workflow?**
---------------------

Workflow is defined as "the sequence of industrial, administrative, or other processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion." In our case, "other processes" refers to putting down working code to make an application. And as a series of processes, they are subject to optimization and improvement. In our case, anything that allows you to create code and applications more quickly and easily can be considered a tool for optimizing your workflow! Here are a couple of my favorite Vim plugins and their closest equivalents in atom. Hopefully there's one here you've never used:

Fuzzy File Finder
----------------

Despite it's cute sounding name, fuzzy file finder is an awesome tool for searching through all of your files. Open this up and start typing at whatever you can remember and it'll return all of the closest results. It's not case sensitive and works on all of your inputs, going through file names and folders to always find you the best result. Shown above is what it looks like for my in Vim but there's one totally similar [here!](https://github.com/atom/fuzzy-finder)

Linters
-------

Do you ever find yourself wishing you could spot pesky syntax errors before running your programs? Well now you can! Linters constantly compile your code looking for errors and showing them in a convenient format while you code. It makes finding and changing them incredibly easy and happens in real time, meaning you don't have to run your program to find out you missed an end:

Some editors come with this functionality built in such as Eclipse, but for the rest of us we have to go out and install it. My linter in Vim looks a little different, but they all follow the same rules. Remember to install language linter packages for the specific languages you're working in!

Beautify
--------

As we stumble our way through our code trying to puzzle together something that works, it's easy to lose track of indentation, spacing and everything else that makes your code readable. Get rid of the repetitive task of deleting extra whitespace or indenting all your line, with the press of a button beautify formats everything for you.

The learning curve
------------------

Adding new new packages, and learning new keybinds is like learning to ride a bike over and over again, and in some cases require reconditioning yourself to work with something new. Take it slowly and try to learn a few things at a time otherwise it can be overwhelming. It's often said that once you're proficient, try to learn one new keybind a a week. And remember, if you find something tedious and repetitive, chances are someone else felt the same way and built a package to fix exactly your needs!
